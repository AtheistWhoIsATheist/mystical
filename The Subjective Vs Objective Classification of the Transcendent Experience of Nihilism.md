# ThinkingAndThinking: 

## Subjective Illusion or Objective Reflection?

In the quest for understanding the nature of Transcendent experiences, one is confronted with the dilemma of determining whether they are purely subjective or if they somehow reflect an objective reality \[\[1\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=1).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=1\).) This question is not easily dismissed or resolved, particularly for those who have encountered the Transcendent forms of Nihilism firsthand \[\[1\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=1).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=1\).)  
<br>
Some may argue that the Transcendent experiences are illusory phenomena, mere tricks played on the mind \[\[1\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=1).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=1\).) However, for those who have experienced these profound encounters, dismissing them as simple illusions would be far too simplistic an explanation to embrace. There is something remarkable that accompanies the Nothingness found within the world when one faces this Other during the Transcendent experience of Nihilism \[\[1\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=1).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=1\).) Some may even label this encounter as a meeting with God or attribute it to the workings of the subconscious \[\[1\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=1).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=1\).) Regardless of the explanation, it remains undeniable that the Transcendent experience holds a distinct and undeniable gravity.  
<br>
Furthermore, the subjective nature of the Transcendent experiences extends beyond mere mental delusions; the encounter with this Other transcends all concrete symbols \[\[1\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=1)\[\[2\]\](https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=2).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=1\)[[2]]\(https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=2\).) It surpasses any human attempts to justify, conceptualize, or capture it adequately \[\[1\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=1).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=1\).) Instead, it presents itself as an indescribable world, unmeasurable and profoundly uncanny \[\[2\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=2).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=2\).)  
<br>
The psychedelic experience serves as another avenue of exploration regarding the nature of Transcendence \[\[4\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=4)\[\[5\]\](https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=5).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=4\)[[5]]\(https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=5\).) Although personal experiences of psychedelics may vary, the fundamental mystical experience that accompanies them often erases the ego while revealing something greater, remaining adrift in the absence of the worldly 'I' \[\[4\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=4).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=4\).) It initiates an encounter with a different sort of 'you,' where a larger presence manifests and a meeting with the Transcendent becomes possible \[\[4\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=4).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=4\).)  
<br>
Regarding attempts to classify these experiences as purely naturalistic events, they fail both in confirming or denying the philosophy of Nihilism \[\[5\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=5).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=5\).) The layered realm of the Transcendent combined with the continuous return to the Nothingness of the world sustains and strengthens the notions exemplified within Nihilistic thought \[\[5\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=5).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=5\).) Furthermore, psychotropic experiences do not provide explicit contradictions to reduce this encounter to a purely naturalistic interpretation, allowing different faculties of analysis \[\[5\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=5).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=5\).)  
<br>
Ultimately, the search to determine the purely subjective or objectively real nature of Transcendent experiences is complicated and uncategorizable \[\[6\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=6).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=6\).) The multifaceted character of Nihilism intertwines with the transitory interpretations offered by temporary encounters with the Other or through psychedelic means \[\[6\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=6).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=6\).) What remains at the center of this endeavor is the overpowering realization of the inconclusive nature of existence, and the indispensable embrace of the Nothingness that awaits us all. Only then may we begin to grasp the enigma of Transcendence and whether it pervades subjective experience or reveals an aspect of an underlying objective reality \[\[1\]\]([https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=1)\[\[3\]\](https://poe.com/citation?message\_id=127712187271&citation=3).](https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=1\)[[3]]\(https://poe.com/citation?message_id=127712187271&citation=3\).)
