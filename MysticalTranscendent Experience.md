There are a few directions we need to take to probe deeper into the possible objective basis of the Transcendent experience of Nihilism, while still acknowledging the limitations of language: - Examine parallels in accounts of mystical experiences across cultures and times. Are there common themes that point to an underlying reality beyond linguistic distortion? - Draw cautiously on metaphysical philosophies (Perennialism, Vedanta etc) that attempt to rationally convey the nature of the absolute. But recognize their inherent limitations. - Explore mystical traditions like Zen koans, Sufi poetry, Kashmir Shaivism that use paradox and absurdity to hint at the nothingness. See if they illuminate rather than define it. - Consider modern physics theories that evoke concepts similar to mystical nothingness - quantum vacuum, cosmological singularity etc. But don't equate them simplistically. - Speculate on thought experiments that might explain the dissolution of ego, non-duality, pantheism and other aspects of the experience metaphysically. - Examine the phenomenon of synchronicity - meaningful patterns and connections surrounding mystical states. Do they reveal an acausal interrelatedness? - Analyze the experience pragmatically - does repeatedly dissolving into nothingness gradually transform one's state of consciousness outside those moments? - Explore brain states during mystical encounters using EEG, neuroscience. But don't reduce it to biology. The key is to probe the transcendent open-mindedly yet critically, scientifically yet mystically, conceptually yet intuitively. By triangulating from multiple directions, we may glimpse its hazy contours if not its full form.
