# The Natural Repulsion of Psychedelics

What is the so called ‘natural’ repulsion, by most humans, to the ideas of, say something like psilocybin, as being something horrible, so widespread and common? Culture? Yes. Tradition? Yes. How people have been raised and told what to believe definitely affects a person's perception of things. But it seems almost more than that. I mean, there are many people who have outwardly spoken up about their use and experiences of psychedelics. They all pretty much say the same thing, or something that isn't completely foreign from any of the other stories being told. And yet, humans aren't rushing out by the millions to see what the hype is all about. People drink whey protein. They take antibiotics. Why be so repulsed and critical of something you haven't even tried or experienced before? As we said, societal pressures play a huge role in this negative outlook on psychedelics, there's no doubt. But there must be something else, something \*\*MORE\*\* than a person's upbringing being the sole factor. What is it? What are the other reasons?
