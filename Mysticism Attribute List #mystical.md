## Mysticism Attribute List #mystical

I suggested making a list and it produced this: 

## TOC

1. Common Structures/Reports of Transcendent Experiences

<br>

<br>

## Common Structures:

-      Ordered from "most commonly reported" to "idiosyncratic"
-      based on reports from mystical experiences across various traditions and philosophies
-     "Sense of Unity or Oneness",

-     "Loss of Sense of Self",
-     "Feeling of Awe or Wonder",
-     "Ineffability (Inability to Describe the Experience)",
-     "Altered Sense of Time",
-     "Deep Emotional Resonance (e.g., Love, Peace)",
-     "Sensory Overload or Amplification",
-     "Feeling of Divine Presence",
-     "Encounter with Archetypal Entities or Symbols",
-     "Revelatory Insights or Epiphanies",
-     "Sense of Sacredness",
-     "Visual or Auditory Hallucinations",
-     "Out-of-Body Experience",
-     "Dark Night of the Soul (Despair, Isolation)",
-     "Visions of Cosmic Order or Universal Structure",
-     "Specific Personal Messages or Guidance",
-     "Psychic Abilities or Premonitions",
-     "Kundalini Awakening or Energy Surge",
-     "Physical Healings or Transformations",
-     "Encounters with Deceased Loved Ones"
- "Sense of Unity or Oneness": 

    - How does this sense of unity or oneness manifest across different cultures and spiritual traditions? Could this suggest a universal truth about the nature of existence?
- "Loss of Sense of Self": 
    - What implications does this have for our understanding of the self and identity? Could this loss of self be a form of 'ego death'?
- "Feeling of Awe or Wonder": 
    - How does this feeling relate to our human capacity for curiosity and exploration? Could this be a fundamental aspect of our relationship with the universe?
- "Ineffability (Inability to Describe the Experience)": 
    - What does this tell us about the limitations of language and human cognition? Could there be other ways of knowing or understanding that transcend language?
- "Altered Sense of Time": 
    - How does this altered sense of time relate to our ordinary perception of time? Could this suggest that time is not as linear or fixed as we usually perceive it to be?
- "Deep Emotional Resonance (e.g., Love, Peace)": 
    - How does this emotional resonance relate to our human capacity for empathy and compassion? Could this suggest a deeper, more profound form of emotional connection that transcends our ordinary emotional experiences?
- "Sensory Overload or Amplification": 
    - How does this sensory overload relate to our ordinary sensory experiences? Could this suggest that our senses are capable of perceiving more than we usually realize?
- "Feeling of Divine Presence": 
    - How does this feeling manifest across different religious and spiritual traditions? Could this suggest a universal experience of the divine?
- "Encounter with Archetypal Entities or Symbols": 
    - How do these archetypal entities or symbols relate to our collective unconscious? Could this suggest a universal language of symbols that transcends cultural differences?
- "Revelatory Insights or Epiphanies": 
    - How do these insights or epiphanies relate to our ordinary cognitive processes? Could this suggest a form of 'higher' or 'transcendent' cognition?
