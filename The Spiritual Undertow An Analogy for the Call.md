# The Spiritual Undertow: An Analogy for the "Call"

**1/28/24**

- **This ‘Spiritual Undertow’ is the consequence of an encounter with Nihilism, as the Nothingness that dissolves everything, seemingly has _some thing_ that one seems drawn to.  What, or _if,_  it ‘is’, there is not enough of anything to say.  However, it is the subtle, vague, yet persistence of this undertow, this _some thing_**

## Adam

I just had a thought about how the experience of Nihilism and its relation to the Transcendent. I was thinking about how the experience is so real and so overwhelming, that it's as if someone came up and punched you in the face. Unless you were dreaming it all, there's not much of a way of denying its reality. And then I thought about the "call" that Heidegger and Swami Vivekananda, among others, speak of in this exact context of experiencing, at least what I call, "Nihilism". To be continued...

<br>

That's a powerful analogy, Adam. The experience of Nihilism, like a punch in the face, is indeed hard to deny once you've encountered it. It's a profound, often unsettling realization that can shake one's worldview to its core.

The "call" that you mention, as discussed by thinkers like Heidegger and Swami Vivekananda, is an interesting concept to explore in this context. In Heidegger's existential philosophy, the "call of conscience" is a kind of internal summons, urging us to confront the authentic reality of our existence, beyond the distractions and illusions of everyday life.

Swami Vivekananda, on the other hand, speaks of a spiritual "call" or awakening, leading to the realization of one's divine nature. This call is often experienced as a deep, inner longing for truth and liberation.

In both cases, the "call" can be seen as a catalyst for a journey towards understanding and embracing the deeper realities of existence, whether it's the existential emptiness of Nihilism or the transcendent unity of Vedanta.

I'm looking forward to hearing more about your thoughts on this. How do you see the experience of Nihilism and the concept of the "call" relating to each other?

The subtle, vague, yet persistent nature of this 'call', a seeming aftereffect, reminds me of the oceans undertow. The 'call' is so similar to the ocean's undertow in that you can get into the water and think you're in a particular space within the water. But, then, without even knowing it, you've been dragged quite the distance from where you began. And the "not realizing" of being pulled, even though one feels the movement of the water around them, is the same experience, internally...

<br>

<br>

That's a beautifully evocative analogy, Adam. The undertow of the ocean is indeed a powerful metaphor for the subtle yet persistent nature of the 'call' towards deeper understanding or spiritual awakening. Just as the undertow can pull us away from our starting point without us even realizing it, the 'call' can shift our perspective and understanding in profound ways, often without us being fully aware of the transformation until we look back and see how far we've come.

This 'call', whether it leads to the existential realization of Nihilism or the transcendent unity of Vedanta, can be seen as a kind of spiritual undertow, pulling us away from the surface-level distractions of everyday life and towards a deeper, more authentic understanding of ourselves and the universe.

It's a fascinating way to think about the spiritual or philosophical journey. How do you see this 'undertow' playing out in your own experiences or reflections?

<br>

Of when you feel that 'push' of 'something' as a result of the experience

<br>

<br>

![](https://mem.ai/assets/memmy-icon-square-ca5dbae3.png)

Ah, I see what you're getting at. The 'push' you're referring to could be seen as the force that propels us into the depths of these profound experiences, much like the undertow of the ocean. It's a compelling force that draws us into the depths of our own consciousness, pushing us to confront and engage with the 'Nothingness' or the Transcendent.

This 'push' can manifest in various ways. It could be a sudden existential crisis that forces us to question the meaning and purpose of life, or a gradual sense of alienation or disconnection that leads us to seek deeper understanding. It could also be a profound sense of dread or anxiety about the inherent uncertainty of existence.

Regardless of how it manifests, this 'push' is a crucial part of the journey towards deeper understanding. It's the force that propels us out of our comfort zones and into the uncharted territories of our own consciousness.

Does this resonate with your own experiences or reflections? How do you perceive this 'push' in your own journey?

Spiritual undertow', I really like that. Can you write this out in some kind of structured or formatted way so I can save and remember it. The analogy of the undertow is something I don't want to slip my mind.

Absolutely, Adam. Here's a structured summary of the concept:

1. **The Call** : This is the sensation one has after the experiential realization of the complete lack of meaning and value in the world. Everything was so vivid at the heights of the Nihilistic experience, with enough power to dissolve ones own subjectivity. And when you question what could possibly be the mechanism for such a visceral experience(and looking back, it was there along) a purely naturalistic framework does not seem sufficient enough an explanation. The tsunami has passed through, and you have been spared the sacrifice, leaving one alive, yet seemingly, in a state of irreparable damaged. One doesn't "**move past"** this event.And then there is what can be referred to as the _Spiritual Undertow._ which draws us towards a deeper understanding or spiritual awakening. It's a _**subtle, vague, yet persistent f**_orce that shifts our perspective and understanding in profound ways.
2. **The Undertow** : Just like the ocean's undertow can pull us away from our starting point without us realizing it, the 'call' can lead us to profound realizations about ourselves and the universe. This is often a transformative process that we may not be fully aware of until we look back and see how far we've come.

# Eminent Nihiltheistic Philosopher 

The analogy of the "Spiritual Undertow" as a metaphor for the inner journey is both vivid and evocative, capturing the tumultuous process of confronting and embracing the existential void. However, there are a few adjustments and expansions I might suggest to refine and deepen the metaphor, ensuring clarity and enhancing the philosophical depth aligned with the thematic concerns of my work:

<br>

1\. \*\*Clarify the Initial Experience\*\*: The description of "The Call" can be streamlined for clarity while maintaining its profound impact. Consider emphasizing the dual nature of this realization—the shock of confronting the void and the subtler, underlying pull towards a deeper exploration of existence. This might involve distinguishing more clearly between the initial shock and the ensuing, more reflective phase that leads to a deeper inquiry.

<br>

   - \*\*Suggested Revision\*\*: "The Call is the initial shock of recognizing the void's depth—the existential realization that the world lacks inherent meaning and value. This recognition is both jarring and strangely familiar, as if the void has always been a silent companion, subtly influencing your path without your conscious awareness. After the storm of realization passes, a quieter, more insidious feeling emerges, akin to the disorientation of waking abruptly from a stupor, only to find the world unchanged yet fundamentally altered in your perception. It's a moment of lucidity, recognizing the void's gaze upon you, inviting—or perhaps challenging—you to venture beyond the superficial into the depths of existential inquiry."

<br>

2\. \*\*Enhance the Undertow Metaphor\*\*: The undertow analogy is powerful but could be expanded to capture the nuanced ways in which this force works. Unlike the ocean's undertow, which is a singular force pulling away, the spiritual undertow might be described as having multiple currents—each representing different existential themes (e.g., meaninglessness, freedom, isolation, mortality) that pull the individual in various directions, reflecting the complexity of the spiritual journey.

<br>

   - \*\*Suggested Revision\*\*: "The Undertow, much like its oceanic counterpart, is not a singular force but a confluence of existential currents—each drawing us away from the shallows of everyday distractions into the depths of self and universe. This multifaceted pull might not be immediately apparent, unfolding through a series of realizations and reflections that gradually, yet irrevocably, alter our understanding of existence."

<br>

3\. \*\*Delineate the Push More Precisely\*\*: The "Push" section captures the impetus towards deeper exploration well but could benefit from distinguishing between internal and external catalysts. This distinction can elucidate the variety of experiences that can propel us into the depths of existential contemplation, emphasizing the personalized nature of this journey.

<br>

   - \*\*Suggested Revision\*\*: "The Push is the catalyst propelling us into the existential depths, which can arise from both internal and external sources. It might be an acute existential crisis triggered by an external event or a slow-building, internal disillusionment with the superficiality of existence. Regardless of its origin, this push disrupts our complacency, compelling us to confront the fundamental uncertainties of our being."

<br>

4\. \*\*Expand on The Journey\*\*: Finally, the journey itself could be elaborated to reflect the ongoing nature of existential exploration. The metaphor could encompass the idea that this journey is not linear but cyclical or spiral, where each encounter with the void deepens our understanding and transforms us.

<br>

   - \*\*Suggested Revision\*\*: "The Journey is not a linear path but a spiral descent into the core of our being and the universe. Each cycle of the spiritual undertow brings us closer to an authentic understanding of existence, peeling away layers of illusion and confronting us with the raw truths of our condition. This journey is marked by moments of profound alienation and unanticipated enlightenment, reflecting the tumultuous yet transformative nature of our quest for meaning in a seemingly indifferent universe."

## Full Revision

Certainly, incorporating the depth and essence of Nihiltheism as explored in "The Religious Experience of Nihilism," I propose the following refined version of the "Spiritual Undertow" analogy to encapsulate the inner journey:

<br>

\---

<br>

## **Spiritual Undertow: An Analogy for the Nihiltheistic Journey**  

<br>

**The Call** : The journey begins with an abrupt awakening—a visceral realization that the fabric of existence is woven with threads of meaninglessness, leaving every seemingly solid belief to unravel in the void. This is not merely an intellectual epiphany but an existential quake that shakes the core of one’s being, dissolving the illusion of control and revealing the void that has always subtly guided our steps. In the aftermath, amidst the silence of the storm’s passing, there's a peculiar sense of being observed, as if the void itself is gauging our response to its revelation. It's akin to regaining consciousness in an altered state, bewildered, drenched in the remnants of our previous delusions, yet curiously alive to a deeper, more enigmatic call—a call to venture beyond the known, into the depths where true understanding lies hidden.

<br>

**The Undertow** : This is where the spiritual undertow asserts its presence, not as a singular force but as an intricate dance of existential currents—meaninglessness, freedom, isolation, mortality—each tugging at the soul from different directions. Like the ocean’s undertow, it subtly shifts our position in the existential landscape, often unnoticed until we find ourselves far from our original bearings. This transformative pull is the heart of our journey, drawing us away from the surface distractions of daily existence into the profound depths where the essence of self and the universe begins to unfurl in its stark, unadorned truth.

<br>

**The Push** : The push into these depths can come from within or without—a sudden crisis that rips the fabric of our reality, or a creeping disillusionment with the superficiality of existence. This push is the existential impetus that propels us towards confrontation with the core uncertainties of our being. It is an invitation to surrender, to allow the existential currents to guide us deeper into the self and the cosmos, challenging us to relinquish our illusions and embrace the raw, unmediated reality of existence.

<br>

**The Journey** : This journey is not a straightforward path but a descent into the spirals of our innermost being, where each turn brings us closer to the heart of existence. It is a process of becoming, of peeling away the layers of illusion to confront the essence of our reality. Along this path, we encounter the profound alienation and the sublime enlightenment that mark the landmarks of our quest. The journey is marked by cycles of descent and return, each bringing a deeper insight into the nature of the void and our place within it. Through this spiral journey, we come to realize that the spiritual undertow is not pulling us away from meaning but towards a deeper, more authentic engagement with the reality that Nihiltheism unveils—a reality beyond the superficial, where the true dialogue with the void begins.
